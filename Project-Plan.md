### **Problem Identification**
    - Define the problem that you're trying to solve with your program. 
    - Write down the goals and objectives of the program. 
### **Requirements Gathering**
    - Determine functional requirements (what the system should do)
    - Determine non-funcitonal requirements (how the system should behave)
        - Performance, security, user experience
    - Consider constraints
        - Time, budget, resources
### **Research & Feasibility Study**
    - Research possible solutions/techniques that could be used to implement the program. 
    - Perform a feasibility study to see if your proposed solution is achievable within your constraints. 
### **System Design**
    - Design the architecture of your program, breaking it down into atomic components.
    - Define how the components will interact. 
    - Determine data structures, algorithms. 
### **Planning Development**
    - Choose the programming languages and tools you'll employ.
    - Set up your development environment.
    - Divide the work into tasks and create a timeline
### **Testing Plan**
    - Define how you will test each component of your program to ensure appropriate function. 
    - Determine how you will handle bugs, errors. 
    - Plan for different types of testing
        - Unit testing
        - Integration testing
        - System testing
### **Maintenance & Future Development**
    - Consider required maintenance after release.
    - Plan for updates, features
    - Consider how you might handle user feedback, issues.
### **Documentation**
    - Developers (code comments, technical documents, architecture diagrams)
    - Users (manuals, help guides)
### **Risk Management**
    - ID potential risks and challenges that could arise during development.
    - Create contingency plans for risk mitigation.
### **Review**
    - Review the entire process to ensure that it is comprehensive
        - Nothing missed
    - Be ready to revise your plan as required. 
        - As you learn more about the problem, things may change.
